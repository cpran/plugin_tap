Description:
  - Short: simple implementation of the Test Anything Protocol
  - Long: >
      The Test Anything Protocol (TAP) offers a unified format for a stream of
      test results that can be used for all sorts of testing.

      This plugin implements a basic interface to set up tests in Praat scripts.
      It is heavily influenced by the similarly named CPAN module.
