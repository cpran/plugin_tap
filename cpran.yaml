Description:
  Short: simple implementation of the Test Anything Protocol
  Long: >
    The Test Anything Protocol (TAP) offers a unified format for a stream of
    test results that can be used for all sorts of testing.

    This plugin implements a basic interface to set up tests in Praat scripts.
    It is heavily influenced by the similarly named CPAN module.

    Despite its simplicity, it allows a safe interface to run planned and
    unplanned tests, as well as to conditionally skip or mark them as
    incomplete tests. This is possible both for a specified number of tests,
    and as a test block. Mass skipping, and test-suite interruption are
    also possible.
