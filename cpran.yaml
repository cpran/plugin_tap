Description:
  Short: simple implementation of the Test Anything Protocol
  Long: >
    The Test Anything Protocol (TAP) offers a unified format for a stream of
    test results that can be used for all sorts of testing.

    This plugin implements a basic interface to set up tests in Praat scripts.
    It is heavily influenced by the similarly named CPAN module.
