Description:
  Short: an implementation of the Test Anything Protocol
  Long: >
    The Test Anything Protocol (TAP) offers a unified format for a stream of
    test results that can be used for all sorts of testing.

    This plugin implements an interface based in that of the Test::Simple and
    the Test::More modules available for CPAN.

    It allows a safe interface to run planned and unplanned tests, as well
    as to conditionally skip or mark them as incomplete tests. This is
    possible both for a specified number of tests, and as a test block. Mass
    skipping, and test-suite interruption are also possible, as is the printing
    of messages without disrupting the TAP stream.
